# React + TypeScript + Vite
# CarFilters Application

## Overview

CarFilters is a simple React-based project created with Vite. This application allows users to filter vehicles by type (make) and model year, and view the results. While the requirements mentioned Next.js, this implementation uses React due to the developer's experience and proficiency with it. Vite is used as the build tool for faster development.

## Notes

| Feature                                          | Description                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **React Instead of Next.js**                       | Implemented using React due to developer familiarity and lack of Next.js experience. |
| **Suspense Component**                             | Not used. Redux Toolkit handles state management effectively.                           |
| **Environment Variables**                         | Vite uses import.meta.env syntax for environment variables. Adjust configurations accordingly. |
| **Navigation Convenience**                        | Includes a "Return to Home" button for better user experience.                     |

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
